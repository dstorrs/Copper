* Design Goals
*** Be fast and robust enough to use in production
*** Be easy enough to use for prototyping
*** Be simple to understand

* Components
*** Source
***** Implements CopperEmitter
*** Pipe
***** Takes an arrayref of Copper::Source 
******* Autoboxes if given only one
******* Defaults to 
***** Takes an arrayref of Copper::Sinks
******* Autoboxes if given only one
******* Defaults to Copper::Sink::STDOUT
***** Takes a CODEREF that implements a transform
*** Sink

* Thoughts
*** Transforms should be coro's so they don't stall processing
*** Should you be able to give an array of transforms?

Probably not.  You can do the same thing simply by wrapping subs in
subs and passing in the outermost sub.
